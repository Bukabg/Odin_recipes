    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Egusi soup is native to West Africa (Nigeria), and many of my American and Nigerian friends have enjoyed it. It
        is a great soup for those who like to try something different every once in a while. Ground Egusi seeds give
        this soup a unique color and flavor. If you can't find Egusi seeds, you can substitute pumpkin seeds. Any
        combination of crab, shrimp, and smoked fish can be used in place of the shrimp. Drained, smoked oysters and
        chicken can be used in place of the beef.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>¾ cup pumpkin seeds</li>
            <li>1 ½ pounds cubed beef stew meat</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
            <li>½ cup peanut oil</li>
            <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
            <li>2 habanero peppers, seeded and minced</li>
            <li>2 pounds fresh shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
            <li>18 ounces tomato sauce</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups water</li>
            <li> 3 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
